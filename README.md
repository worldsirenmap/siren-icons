# Siren Icons / Marker

This repository provides freely available siren icons that are used on the WorldSirenMap.

Additional icons can be added via PullRequest. The SVG images have a resolution of 60x40 pixels and consist of exactly one continuous path.

Issues for missing icons can also be created, please add images/links as a template.

## Icon-Sprite

The icons are automatically combined into a PNG sprite for the WorldSirenMap.
